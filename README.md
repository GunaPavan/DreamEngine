# ðŸ§  DreamEngine

> *Cognitively-inspired AI agent simulating consciousness-like behavior through recursive introspection, hallucinated belief drift, and memory-based dreaming â€” built with LangChain, local LLMs, and vector memory.*

---

**DreamEngine** is an experimental agent architecture that models emergent cognition in large language models. It emulates how humans dream, misremember, hallucinate beliefs, and reinforce self-narratives. This is achieved through modular recursive loops powered by vector memory (FAISS/Qdrant), local LLMs (Mistral, LLaMA, etc.), and LangChain pipelines.

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `agent.py`              | Central control loop for recursive thought |
| `memory.py`             | Long-term memory with vector stores        |
| `hallucination.py`      | Belief mutation, synthetic recall          |
| `cognitive_loops.py`    | Dream cycles, introspective reasoning      |
| `examples/simulate_*.py`| Experimental behavior simulation           |
